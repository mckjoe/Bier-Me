# Title
Bier Haus

## About
This is a fictional tap list for a local beer drinking hang created using React.

## Description
Originally Bier Haus was created in Angular and followed the Angular component structure, but the goal this time around is to make it with the React component structure.  Im going to follow along with my original site as much as possible, but in the Angular version I didn't do much styling and didn't have any routing, so at some point I'm going to have to deviate from the original project so that I can have more work to do.  The original angular version can be viewed at https://github.com/mckjoe/Bier-Haus, clone that project to your desktop, type npm install into your terminal from the projects home directory, then when all dependencies are installed type "ng serve --open" and the project will open in a live development server.  There is also a screen shot of the priginal project in the folder marked drawings_componentTree.

### Planning
Since I am re-doing a site that had relatively little styling or layout work done on it, I plan to spend a little time this morning planning out how I want my site to look when it is done.  I'll do a couple of quick sketches so I can plan my component structure then start getting things put into place before I start coding anything. The sketches are available to be viewed in the folder titled drawings_componentTree in the top level of my project directory.

### Notes
I didn't run into a ton of unforeseen problems today.  Some of the styling took me a little bit longer than I would have liked and longer than I anticipated but I didn't have any huge hold-ups.  I'd hoped to get to adding content to the admin component today too, but I didn't get that far so I will work some more on it throughout the week next week to make sure its ready to be finished next week.  the admin component will be the keg list and the bottle list combined, and then there will be a button for editing, removing, and then adding a full new keg to the list.  I also would like to get another component made up for all three lists that lets users click on one of the items and view a more detailed version of what they are looking at.  

### Questions/Prompts
As far as the difference between the two component structures, It seems like React components are far more modular.  In React There's tons of them; components are made of components, which are made of components that are made of components.  It's a bit crazy, but a bit amazing because I can see how it really lets you reuse components around a project and to also have a lot of control over how they behave.  I think once I know more about state I'll have  better understanding about the component structure that React uses, but for now I can tell there is a fairly significant difference if nowhere else then in the size of the components. Angular uses lots of components to break down processes and purposes where it seems like React more or less turns just about everything into a component.  

## Component Tree is in Folder called drawings_componentTree
